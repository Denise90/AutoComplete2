# AutoComplete2
Assignment details:
Your assignment is to develop a java program that reads in a list of strings(called terms) 
and associated weights from a URL or file and stores them in a suitable data structure. 
The user should then be able to enter a prefix string and the program should return a list of matching phrases that start with that text.
All matching phrases should be displayed and the search should be case insensitive.



The bruteforce attempt is complete in this project, with working returning term weights, best matches, all matches.
The quick attempt is not complete as I managed my time poorly
